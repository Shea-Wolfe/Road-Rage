# Getting Started:

road_rage.ipynb is a scratch notebook for this file where the classes were originally built and most of the testing happened.  It remains as a workspace and test area.

road_rage_classes.py is a module built to hold the classes and imports needed to simulate traffic.  In order to use it make sure it is in the same directory as the file you are in and type "from road_rage_classes import \*" at the top to import the data.

road_rage_final.ipynb contains the final graphs and examples of data.  In order to open it make sure you've installed the requirements.txt and have road_rage_classes in the same directory and enter $ ipython notebook in the terminal.  From there select road_rage_final.

requirements.txt is a file containing the downloads needed for these programs.  To install it in your environment type $ pip install requirements.txt

# Description

The point of these files is to simulate a 1Km stretch of road with 30 cars on it given a set of givens.  We are attempting to learn the ideal speed limit for the road.  Conclusions drawn from the data are in road_rage_final.ipynb.
